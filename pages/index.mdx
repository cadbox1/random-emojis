# Random Emojis

## Background

I had an idea for a new app called Random Recipes and worked out I could do the first version on the frontend, easy! I've built a few NextJS apps now and I'm getting pretty good at it, I even created some reusable components, cadells-vanilla-components, as part of my last project, random-emojis.

All I have to do is rip out the frontend from random-emojis, strip it back and I'm ready to start developing random-recipes. But what about the next project? It would be great to have a template all ready to go with all my favourite things in it.

## User Stories

As Cadell, I want a NextJS template with all my favourite things in it so I can build apps faster in the future.

## Solution

A basic NextJS app setup with MDX, vanilla-extract, cadells-vanilla-components and an emoji favicon.

It should also have some basic headings in the index.mdx to explain my new projects.

I think I'll deploy it to Netlify too.

## Challenges

- I didn't realise Netlify now uses a NextJS plugin so there's no need to update the build command and output directory.

## Notes

Netlify has a NextJS plugin now so you should keep the default build command and publish directory:

- Build command: yarn build
- Publish directory: .next

This project took about 1 hour.

## Milestones

- done - NextJS app
- done - Project headings
- done - Deployment
